NOTES:

- DONE: breakout out enable lines for voltage regulators
- DONE: add at least 1 temp sensor
- DONE: external clock should have an enable
- NO:add schmidt trigger to test efficacy?
- DONE: Do I need level shifting b/c max is 2.8v +0.2v
	-74avcb1642 Bus Tranceiver from schematic
	
- VREGs
	- VDD: 1.8
	- VDD_IO: 2.8
	- VAA: 2.8
	- VAA_PIX: 2.8(maybe can be shared with VAA, though refernce design shows individual)
	- VDD_PLL: 2.8
- LATER: power on sequence
	- attiny or RC circuit
- NOPE: temp sensors on separate 12c lines???
- temp sensor under center of image sensor or under image sensor ground pins
- I2C Repeater on board. ONe of these could be useful on the processor board if separate from camera board.
- temp sensor running at 3.3 but i2c is translated to 2.8. Just keep this in mind
- calculate power dissipation of v-regs
- lens correction EEPROM??
- clock
	- clock buffer(might only be needed for level shifting)
	- Should I use a TCXO
	- DONE: 27MHz?
	- DONE: 100 ohm series resistor?
- YES: Will 3.3v reg be enough for bus tranceiver and temp sensors
- YES: Will 2.8v VDD_IO reg be enough for bus tranceiver and temp sensors
- Ribbon Cable output and external input board
- Reset Voltage Supervisor:TPS3800, to reset when voltage is OK, see dev board.
- Signals pulled up/down with resistor, and possibilty to be broken out
- Test points
	- DONE: clock enable on XO
	- DONE: level shifter enable
	- DONE: flash
	- DONE: vreg outputs
- VREG Caps
	- Input: 1uf
	- NR: .01uf
	- output: 10uf
- DONE: unpopulated pullups on 12c
- connect output tranceiver enable and i2c repeater enable?


NOTES:
- Test points
- Sense resistor on PSUs
