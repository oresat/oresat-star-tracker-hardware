SCN == STENCIL CHANGE NEEDED

DONE - C8 0805 22uF should be 1210 
DONE - see power plane on balls H10 and H11
DONE - C4 0805 10uF should be 0603 like all others on board, unless there is a compelling reason why not
- re-number refers, though this might make the second rev confusing
DONE - it'd be nice if C18, instead of 2.2uF, could be 1uF, or use 2 1uF, 
DONE - rename JTAG header CM1 to Jx
BOM - all parts should have correct MPN as attribute
BOM - D1 should user amber LED part, not green
DONE - 10uF 0603 should be 0805
- in attributes, note part numbers for different temperature grades for ICs, like CLVCH16T245MDGGREP vs 74LVCH16T245DGGRE4
IRRELEVANT - swap tx and rx on UART header
WHAT? - fix resistor on MIC842
DONE - separate C38 and C37
WAHT? - fake label text bigger
SKIP - RC circuit on camera reset, see AR0130 datasheet, pg. 14
DONE ON CAMERA - perhaps optional pullups on camera control lines
DONE - usb lines too close to C37
- this USB ribbon cable is giving me issues, maybe use other type of connector
DONE - R12 was accidentally deleted(no cream)
DONE - R39 label on silk
DONE - c17 label on silk
DONE - breakout I2C0 !!
DONE - TPs on reset circuit
UGH - make font bigger(use minimum oshpark size)
UGH - labeled TPs would be nice
CANT? - would be nice if SD was closer to edge
DONE(TPS) - breakout I2C2 (maybe I2C1 as well)
- pullups/downs on all camera lines, with control buffer disabled, so that comes up and stays in good state until initialized
DONE - fix MIC842 footprint
add debug board
