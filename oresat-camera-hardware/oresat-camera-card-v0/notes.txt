- bus termination resistors
- CAUTION!!! I2C0 has internal pulp resistors, per Table 11, footnote 1 https://octavosystems.com/app_notes/osd335x-schematic-checklist-am335x/
- need to program EEPROM with board ID for u-boot: https://octavosystems.com/app_notes/osd335x-design-tutorial/osd335x-lesson-2-minimal-linux-boot/osd335x-lesson-2-linux-bring-up/
- U-boot will not boot without a valid board ID. What if that EEPROM get’s corrupted in space?
- any pru inputs to measure exposure time?

After checklist:
- really need ~50uF on VDD?
